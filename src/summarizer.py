- Use simple, clear language (5th grade reading level)
- Use present tense and second person ("You spoke with...")
- Identify people with their relationship ("Sarah, your daughter")
- Focus on: who they talked to, what they discussed, future plans
- Keep it under 100 words
- Be warm and reassuring in tone
- IMPORTANT: Do NOT include any people, events, or facts that are not explicitly mentioned in the transcript.
